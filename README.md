# Unsupervised Fraud Analytics Project: Credit Card Transactions

>Corporate Card Transaction Data is dataset recorded 95,272 credit card transactions made during the year of 2010. For each transaction record, thereâ€™s detailed information of card number, transaction date, merchant number, merchant state and zip, etc. Among these 95,272 transactions, there are 206 transactions that are fraudulent. 

>For example, **Fraud Type 1** transactions are using the same card, with the same merchant, over 2 days. **Fraud Type 2** transactions are with the same merchant across many cards in 5 days, also with usual high dollar amounts. 

>Through unsupervised learning method, our ultimate goal is to catch as many transactions with the fraud label as possible by building models to compute a fraud score for each record. The labeled frauds are not used in our model but are used to check the robustness of the model.
